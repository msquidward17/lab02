		<h2>About Hollow Knight</h2>
		
		<p>Hollow Knight is a 2D side-scrolling action adventure video game in the Metroidvania style. It was developed by Team Cherry and released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, the Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and PlayStation.  Development was partially funded through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign, raising over $57,000 by the end of 2014. </p>
		
		<p>At the game's outset, the player character, the Knight, arrives in Dirtmouth, a small town above Hallownest's ruins, seeking to venture within. The game tells the story of a knight on a quest to uncover the secrets of the long-abandoned insect kingdom, Hallownest, whose haunting depths draw in the adventurous and brave with promises of treasures and answers to ancient mysteries. </p>
		
		<p>A sequel to the game, Hollow Knight: Silksong, is currently in development and is set to be released on Microsoft Windows, Mac, Linux and Nintendo Switch. Team Cherry had previously planned this game as a piece of downloadable content. Kickstarter backers of Hollow Knight will also receive Silksong for free when it is released. </p>

		<h2>Gameplay</h2>
		
		<p>Players explore the large interconnected world of Hallownest using a variety of movement and combat techniques. In classic Metroidvania style, there are areas of the world that the player cannot access until they obtain particular items or abilities. Maps for each area must be bought from the cartographer, and the player can also buy upgrades that allow them to reveal parts of the map as they explore. </p>
		
		<p>Many areas have a 'boss' enemy that the player must defeat in order to continue, and a number of sub-bosses that drop useful rewards or upgrades. Defeated enemies drop Geo, a currency that the player can use to buy items from shopkeepers. If the player is killed, they respawn at the last place they rested and lose all their Geo. </p>

		<p>They must then return to their corpse and defeat a ghost in order to recover the currency. The player also earns 'Soul' by attacking enemies, which they can then spend to recover lost health or activate special abilities. Health can also be recovered at hot springs, which are located around the world, or by resting at a bench. </p>

		<h2>Content Packs</h2>
		
		<p>Hidden Dreams is the first of the four free content packs for Hollow Knight. It was released on the 3rd of August, 2017. The main content focuses on bringing in "two of Hallownest’s greatest warriors", along with the first major quality of life changes including a new Stag Station and a new fast travel mechanic. </p>
		

		<p>The Grimm Troupe is the second of the four free content packs for Hollow Knight. It was released on the 26th of October, 2017.In this expansion, a mysterious group of circus performers known as the Grimm Troupe arrives in Dirtmouth. Their leader, Troupe Master Grimm, asks the Knight to take part in a "twisted ritual.” Eventually the Knight must choose to either complete the ritual by fighting Nightmare King Grimm, or to banish the Troupe from Hallownest. </p>

		<p>Lifeblood is the third free content pack to Hollow Knight. It was officially released on 20 April, 2018. As it was not one of the three originally planned content packs, it did not release with a teaser. Lifeblood focused mainly on enhancing technical aspects of the game, bringing upgrades and optimizations of various kinds. </p>

		<p>Godmaster, previously named Gods & Glory, is the fourth and last free content pack for Hollow Knight. It is the final chapter of the Knight's story.
